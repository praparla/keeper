# CLAUDE.md — Universal Development Principles

> Distilled from patterns across multiple projects. Apply universally; skip sections irrelevant to the current project type.

## Agent Workflow: Explore → Plan → Code → Verify

Never blindly write code. Always follow this loop:

1. **Explore** — Search the codebase. Find relevant files, understand existing patterns before touching anything.
2. **Plan** — Assess the blast radius (how many files touched, how long it takes). For significant changes, present 2–3 high-level approaches with pros/cons and ask for human approval before writing code.
3. **Code** — Implement following the rules below.
4. **Verify** — Run tests. Fix all failures before declaring the task complete.

**Read before edit:** Always read a file before editing it, even if it was read earlier in the conversation.

**Ask for options first.** On non-trivial tasks, propose approaches before writing code. The human needs to evaluate options — don't assume the first plausible approach is the right one.

---

## Communication Style

- **Concise output.** No filler, no apologies, no moralizing. Skip generic advice.
- **Show your work.** Use short internal monologues to break down complex problems.
- **Fail loud.** Never use catch-all exception handlers that silently swallow errors. Always raise or log explicitly.

---

## Architecture Principles

- **No over-engineering.** Only make changes directly requested or clearly necessary. Keep solutions simple.
- **Single source of truth.** Constants, configs, and shared types derive from one place.
- **Modular design.** Separate concerns: data fetching, processing, storage, and presentation are distinct layers.
- **Idempotent operations.** Re-running any operation should be safe and produce the same result. Use `INSERT OR IGNORE` patterns, cache checks, or deduplication by unique key.
- **Static when possible.** Prefer baked-in data over runtime backends when the data update cycle allows it.
- **Cost-optimized.** Stay on free tiers and use the cheapest resources that meet requirements.
- **CLI-first.** Build CLI entry points before UI. Agents can invoke CLIs directly to self-validate output, closing the feedback loop without human intervention.
- **Document subsystems.** Maintain a `docs/` folder with notes on non-obvious subsystems, design decisions, and correct CLI invocations. One line of documentation prevents repeated mistakes.

---

## Error Resilience

- **Never let a single item failure crash the pipeline.** Wrap individual record processing in try/except. Log and continue.
- **Log aggressively.** Every request, parse, API call, cache hit/miss, and filter decision should be logged.
- **Cache everything.** Re-runs should be fast and cheap. Multi-layer caching where appropriate.
- **Validate everything.** Invalid responses from external services → log and skip, never crash.
- **Track errors visibly.** Use an `issues.md` file or errors array — failures must be visible, not silent.

---

## Security & Credential Handling

- **Never commit secrets.** API keys, tokens, and passwords must never appear in committed code.
- Read credentials from environment variables only (e.g., `os.environ["API_KEY"]`). Halt with a clear error if missing.
- Never log or print credential values.
- Always `.gitignore`: `.env`, `.env.local`, `credentials.json`, `secrets/`, `node_modules/`, `__pycache__/`, `dist/`, `*.pyc`.
- Before committing: `git diff --cached | grep -iE "apikey|password|token|secret"`.

---

## Testing & Validation

- **Write tests alongside code, not as an afterthought.** Every new module or bug fix includes corresponding tests.
- Write a regression test for every bug fix.
- Validate output data against expected schemas before writing to disk.
- **Cover edge cases, not just happy paths:**
  - Empty input: `[]`, `{}`, `""`
  - Null/undefined for every optional field
  - Boundary values (first/last page, exact date boundaries, zero counts)
  - Combined states (e.g., multiple filters active simultaneously)
- Run the full test suite before committing to catch regressions.

---

## Git Discipline

- **Commit often** at natural checkpoints — small, focused commits over large monolithic ones.
  - After each new module/feature is built
  - After fixing a bug or resolving a failing test
  - After updating documentation
- Write descriptive commit messages explaining *what* and *why*.
- Never commit large binary files, downloaded data, or API keys.

---

## Data Handling

- **Append-only data.** Append new records rather than overwriting. Deduplicate via unique keys.
- **Source attribution.** Every data record must include its origin (source URL, connector name, etc.). Users must be able to trace data back to its source.
- **Defensive optional field handling.** Null-check every optional field before rendering or processing.
- Null values show explicit placeholders ("N/A", "TBD", "Value TBD") — never blank UI elements or missing fields.

---

## Issue Tracking (`issues.md`)

Maintain a living `issues.md` in the project root as an audit trail.

- Log bugs with: date, module/area, description, root cause (**code bug** vs. **test bug**), and status (Open / Fixed).
- Update entries when resolved: what the fix was + the commit that resolved it.
- After every bug fix, check whether a new regression test is needed.

---

## Backlog (`backlog.md`)

Maintain a `backlog.md` for ideas, features, and enhancements.

- When ideas come up during development, add them immediately — don't lose them.
- Each item: brief description + priority (low / medium / high).
- Review and reprioritize periodically.

---

## Python Standards

*(Apply when the project uses Python)*

- Type hints on all functions.
- Use `pathlib.Path` for file paths.
- Use the `logging` module — no bare `print` for runtime output.
- All constants in a single config module.
- Pin dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
- Use Pydantic for data validation.
- Python 3.9+ compatible unless specified otherwise.

---

## Frontend Standards

*(Apply when the project has a web frontend)*

- Functional components + hooks only. No class components.
- Colors, enums, and constants in a dedicated constants file — never hardcoded inline.
- Data transforms belong in hooks or utility functions, not in components.
- Proper loading, error, and empty states on every view.
- All interactive elements must have visible focus indicators for accessibility.
- **Mobile-first responsive design.** All features must work on both mobile and desktop.
- Use TypeScript strict mode when the project uses TypeScript. No `any` types.

---

## Network Ethics & Rate Limiting

*(Apply when the project fetches from external sources)*

- Minimum 1.5–2s delay between requests to any single host.
- Set an informative `User-Agent` header.
- Handle 429 responses with exponential backoff (start at 10s).
- Cache all fetched content to disk. Re-runs should never re-download already-cached content.
- If a service persistently blocks after retries, log to `issues.md` and gracefully skip. Never crash.
- Start small when testing scrapers — validate against a handful of pages before scaling to full runs.

---

## AI/API Cost Optimization

*(Apply when the project uses LLM APIs)*

- Use the cheapest model that meets quality requirements by default (e.g., Haiku before Opus).
- Apply keyword pre-filtering to skip irrelevant content before sending to expensive APIs.
- Truncate/excerpt input text to reduce token usage.
- Cache API responses by content hash. Never re-classify identical content.
- Log cost impact at each optimization layer. Print a cost summary at the end of each run.
- `--dry-run` and `--fetch-only` modes must work without an API key.

---

## Working with AI Agents

*Meta-principles for getting the most out of AI-assisted development.*

- **Context engineering over prompt engineering.** Fill the context window with exactly what's needed — no more, no less. Watch for three failure modes: *context poisoning* (early errors that compound), *context distraction* (irrelevant content that buries what matters), and *context clash* (contradictory instructions).
- **Start fresh on topic switches.** Use `/clear` when moving to an unrelated problem. Long mixed-topic contexts degrade quality. Break complex tasks into small steps and commit between them.
- **AI has no taste.** Actively review output for: excessive try/catch blocks, unnecessary abstractions, code bloat instead of refactoring, and poor judgment on simplicity vs. structure. These are recurring failure modes that require human correction.
- **Closed-loop validation.** Build projects so the agent can compile, lint, run tests, and verify its own output without human intervention. When the agent can close the loop itself, you can trust the result.
- **Keep this file current.** When something unexpected happens — a pattern that failed, a correct CLI invocation, a library quirk — add a concise note here. This file should grow incrementally as organizational scar tissue, not be rewritten from scratch.
- **Write big plans to files.** For large tasks, write the spec to a `docs/` markdown file and review it before executing. This persists context across sessions and allows a second-opinion review before building.
